// FUNCTION PROTOYPES FOR sumOfInts() and greaterThanTen() GO HERE  *



//*******main********
//The user should enter their desired amount of numbers, and the program should display the final value after the operations, as well as if the total is greater than ten or not.
//This logic must be implemented in one line. This means that the main() function can have ONE statement (and the return 0).
//Implement main here:





//******sumOfInts*****
//The user should be prompted to enter how many integers they would like to add together
//Afterwards, the user should enter values until the number of specified integers is reached
//Print and return the sum






//******greaterThanTen*********
//1 parameter, determine if the passed in number is greater than 10
//Print if the value is greater or not greater than ten
